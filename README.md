## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.


There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## To Generate an application

Run `yarn nx generate @nrwl/next:application [my-app]` to generate an new application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@nextjs-templates/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## To Run the application

`yarn nx run [my app]:serve` to run the application


## To Build the application

`yarn nx build [my app]:build` to build the application
